Both **Backend** and **Frontend** should be considered as separated projects each one with its dependencies. if you are about to contribute to this project or just to play around with the code I suggest cloning each master branch in different folders

## About The Project

I based this app on the desktop version of WhatsApp, using the same color schema and layout, following the responsiveness patterns the same way the original WhatsApp web app does.
