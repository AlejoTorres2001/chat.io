**this is the master branch for the server-side code behind *chat.io***

</div>

Both **Backend** and **Frontend** should be considered as separeted projects each one with their own dependencies. if you are about to contribute to this project or just to play around with the code I suggest to clone each master branches in diffrent folders


## About The Project

the Core concept here revolves around WebSocket, instead of the classic server polling architecture, using an event based communication allows for (almost) real time communication between the server and our clients, who will listen and react to the changes

For authentication I've opted for a ***JWT* strategy**, at the project's current state it does not include a refreshToken functionalilty, logging you out once your access token is rejected by the server.
